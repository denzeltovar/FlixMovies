Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Setting up a search bar in Xcode and finding the appropiate methods and values that go with them.
2. Implementation of Cocoapods and what other useful methods can be found to help further customize Xcode.

## Notes

 At various points I have made errors and have gotten mixed up trying to implement fuctions from the wrong view controller. I also felt pretty great with the project. Although I didn't get as far as I would have liked I was able to catch up with all members of my group with a two day delay with my technology.
